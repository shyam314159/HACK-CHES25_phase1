## Introduction and Background

### What is OpenTitan?
OpenTitan is an open-source silicon Root of Trust (RoT) project. Think of it as a specialized computer chip designed to provide the foundational security for other computer systems. It's like a security guard that checks if everything is legitimate before allowing the main computer to start up.

### What is VLSI?
VLSI stands for "Very Large Scale Integration" - it's the process of creating integrated circuits (computer chips) by combining thousands or millions of transistors into a single chip. The code we're analyzing describes how these circuits should behave.

### What is Hardware Description Language (HDL)?
The code files we analyze are written in SystemVerilog, which is a Hardware Description Language. Unlike regular programming languages that describe software, HDL describes how digital circuits should work - like writing instructions for building electronic components.

### What is Hack@CHES'25?
This is a hardware security competition where researchers try to find security vulnerabilities in computer chip designs. The goal is to identify weaknesses that attackers could exploit to compromise system security.

## Environment Setup

### Step 1: Initial Project Setup

First, I created a basic Python environment:

```bash
# Create a simple Hello World program to establish the project
echo '#!/usr/bin/env python3
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()' > hello_world.py

# Make it executable
chmod +x hello_world.py
```

**What this does**: Creates a simple starting point for our project and tests that Python is working correctly.

### Step 2: Extract OpenTitan Source Code

The competition provided a compressed archive containing the OpenTitan source code:

```bash
# Extract the OpenTitan source code from the provided archive
cd attached_assets
tar -xzf hack@ches_p1_25.tar_1751455780111.gz
cd ..
cp -r attached_assets/hack@ches_p1_25 .
```

**What this does**: 
- `tar -xzf` extracts a compressed file (like unzipping)
- `cp -r` copies the entire directory structure to our working location
- This gives us access to thousands of source code files that describe the OpenTitan chip

### Step 3: OpenTitan Environment Configuration

OpenTitan requires specific tools and environment variables:

```bash
# Navigate to the OpenTitan directory
cd hack@ches_p1_25

# Set up the environment using the provided script
source env.sh
```

**What env.sh contains**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# OpenTitan Environment Setup Script

# Set the repository root - this tells tools where to find OpenTitan files
export REPO_TOP=$(pwd)
echo "REPO_TOP: $REPO_TOP"

# Check if Bazel is available and the correct version
# Bazel is a build tool that compiles and tests the OpenTitan code
REQUIRED_BAZEL_VERSION="6.2.1"
echo "Bazel version required: $REQUIRED_BAZEL_VERSION"

# Set up Python path for OpenTitan tools
export PYTHONPATH="$REPO_TOP:$PYTHONPATH"

# Add OpenTitan utility scripts to PATH
export PATH="$REPO_TOP/util:$PATH"

echo "Environment set up for OpenTitan Hack@CHES'25"
```

**Why this is important**: 
- OpenTitan is a complex project with many dependencies
- The environment script ensures all tools can find the files they need
- It sets up paths so we can run analysis tools from anywhere in the project

### Step 4: Understanding the Project Structure

After setup, the OpenTitan directory contains:

```
hack@ches_p1_25/
├── hw/                          # Hardware descriptions (the chip design)
│   ├── ip/                      # Individual IP blocks (components)
│   ├── ip_templates/            # Template designs
│   └── vendor/                  # Third-party components
├── sw/                          # Software that runs on the chip
├── util/                        # Utility scripts and tools
├── BUILD                        # Bazel build configuration
└── env.sh                       # Environment setup script
```

**Key directories for security analysis**:
- `hw/vendor/pulp_riscv_dbg/` - RISC-V debug interface (how developers can inspect the running chip)
- `hw/ip_templates/alert_handler/` - Alert handling system (detects and responds to security threats)

---

## Understanding OpenTitan Architecture

### Core Components We Analyzed

#### 1. RISC-V Debug Module
**What it is**: A special interface that allows developers to debug programs running on the chip. Think of it like a backdoor that developers use to inspect what's happening inside the chip.

**Why it's security-critical**: If an attacker can access this interface, they can:
- Stop and start the processor
- Read all memory contents (including secrets)
- Modify program execution
- Bypass security measures

**Key files**:
- `dm_csrs.sv` - Debug Module Control and Status Registers
- `dmi_jtag.sv` - Debug Module Interface via JTAG (physical connection)

#### 2. Alert Handler
**What it is**: A security monitoring system that watches for threats and suspicious activity. Like a security alarm system for the chip.

**Why it's security-critical**: If an attacker can disable or manipulate this system, they can:
- Hide their malicious activities
- Prevent security responses
- Cause false alarms to mask real attacks

**Key files**:
- `alert_handler.sv` - Main alert processing logic
- `alert_handler_ping_timer.sv` - System that periodically checks if alerts are working

## Vulnerability Discovery Methodology

### Approach 1: Automated Pattern Analysis

I created Python scripts to systematically search for common vulnerability patterns in the hardware description code:

```python
def analyze_file_for_patterns(self, filepath: Path) -> List[Tuple[int, str, str]]:
    """
    Analyze a file for security vulnerability patterns
    """
    findings = []
    
    # Define patterns that often indicate security vulnerabilities
    vulnerability_patterns = [
        # Access control issues
        (r'debug.*(?:read|write|access).*(?:without|bypass)', 'Access Control Bypass'),
        (r'(?:privilege|permission).*(?:check|valid).*(?:missing|skip)', 'Missing Privilege Check'),
        
        # State handling issues  
        (r'reset.*(?:state|clear).*(?:fail|error)', 'Reset State Handling'),
        (r'state.*transition.*(?:invalid|illegal)', 'Invalid State Transition'),
        
        # Timing vulnerabilities
        (r'timeout.*(?:bypass|skip|ignore)', 'Timeout Bypass'),
        (r'race.*condition', 'Race Condition'),
        
        # Error handling
        (r'error.*(?:suppress|ignore|hide)', 'Error Suppression'),
        (r'exception.*(?:handle|catch).*(?:missing|empty)', 'Poor Error Handling')
    ]
```

**How this works**:
1. **Pattern Matching**: The script searches for specific code patterns that commonly indicate security issues
2. **Context Analysis**: When a pattern is found, it examines surrounding code for additional context
3. **Severity Assessment**: Based on the pattern and context, it assigns a severity level

### Approach 2: Manual Code Review

For critical components, I performed detailed manual analysis:

#### Example: Debug Access Control Analysis

Looking at `dm_csrs.sv` line 380:
```systemverilog
// This code handles debug register writes
if (dmi_req_i.op == dm::DTM_WRITE) begin
  // Write to debug registers without checking if user is authorized
  unique case (dmi_req_i.addr)
    dm::DMControl: begin
      // Critical: No permission check before allowing control operations!
      dmcontrol_d = dmi_req_i.data;
    end
```

**Why this is vulnerable**:
1. **Missing Authorization**: The code allows write operations to critical debug registers
2. **No Privilege Check**: There's no verification that the requester has permission
3. **Impact**: An attacker can control CPU execution without authentication

#### Example: Reset Race Condition Analysis

Looking at `dmi_jtag.sv` line 65:
```systemverilog
// Combine multiple reset sources
assign dmi_clear = jtag_dmi_clear || (dtmcs_select && update && dtmcs_q.dmihardreset);
```

**Why this creates a race condition**:
1. **Timing Dependency**: Two different reset signals are combined with OR logic
2. **No Synchronization**: No mechanism ensures both resets complete properly
3. **Exploitation**: An attacker can manipulate timing to cause partial resets

### Approach 3: SystemVerilog-Specific Analysis

Hardware description languages have unique vulnerability patterns:

#### Clock Domain Issues
```systemverilog
// Problematic: Signal crosses clock domains without synchronization
always_ff @(posedge clk_a) begin
  signal_a <= data_in;
end

always_ff @(posedge clk_b) begin  
  // Using signal_a here without proper synchronization can cause race conditions
  data_out <= signal_a;  
end
```

#### Reset Logic Vulnerabilities
```systemverilog
// Problematic: Incomplete reset handling
always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
  if (!rst_n) begin
    // Only some registers are reset - others retain old values!
    reg1 <= '0;
    // reg2 is not reset - potential security issue
  end else begin
    reg1 <= next_val1;
    reg2 <= next_val2;  // This keeps old value across reset
  end
end
```

## Detailed Vulnerability Analysis

### Vulnerability Category 1: Debug Interface Access Control

#### Bug #1: Debug Operations Without Authorization

**Location**: `hw/vendor/pulp_riscv_dbg/src/dm_csrs.sv`, line 380

**Vulnerable Code**:
```systemverilog
if (dmi_req_i.op == dm::DTM_WRITE) begin
  unique case (dmi_req_i.addr)
    dm::DMControl: begin
      dmcontrol_d = dmi_req_i.data;  // No authorization check!
    end
    dm::Command: begin  
      command_d = dmi_req_i.data;    // Direct command execution!
    end
```

**Detailed Explanation**:

1. **What the code does**: This handles requests to write to debug module registers
2. **The vulnerability**: Anyone who can send debug requests can write to critical control registers
3. **Expected behavior**: Should check if the requester has debug privileges before allowing writes
4. **Attack scenario**: 
   - Attacker connects to JTAG interface
   - Sends debug write request to DMControl register
   - Gains full control over CPU execution
   - Can halt CPU, read memory, inject code

**Impact Assessment**:
- **Confidentiality**: HIGH - Can read all system memory including secrets
- **Integrity**: HIGH - Can modify program execution and data
- **Availability**: HIGH - Can halt system operation
- **CVSS Score**: 8.2 (High)

**Proof of Concept**:
```systemverilog
// Test case demonstrating the vulnerability
initial begin
  // Simulate unauthorized debug access attempt
  dmi_req.op = dm::DTM_WRITE;
  dmi_req.addr = dm::DMControl;
  dmi_req.data = 32'h80000001;  // Set dmactive and haltreq bits
  
  // This should fail but will succeed due to missing auth check
  apply_dmi_request();
  
  // Verify system was compromised
  assert(cpu_halted == 1'b1) else $error("CPU should be halted by unauthorized access");
end
```

#### Bug #2: Abstract Command Execution Without Validation

**Location**: `hw/vendor/pulp_riscv_dbg/src/dm_csrs.sv`, line 420

**Vulnerable Code**:
```systemverilog
dm::Command: begin
  // Execute abstract commands without validation
  if (32'(abstractcs_q.cmderr) == dm::CmdErrNone) begin
    command_d = dmi_req_i.data;  // Direct command execution
  end
end
```

**What abstract commands are**: Special debug commands that can read/write registers, memory, and control CPU execution.

**The vulnerability**: Commands are executed based only on error status, not user authorization.

**Attack impact**: Attacker can execute any debug command including:
- Reading processor registers (including security keys)
- Writing to memory (injecting malicious code)
- Single-stepping through secure code

### Vulnerability Category 2: Reset Logic Race Conditions

#### Bug #3: Debug State Persistence Across Resets

**Location**: `hw/vendor/pulp_riscv_dbg/src/dmi_jtag.sv`, line 65

**Vulnerable Code**:
```systemverilog
assign dmi_clear = jtag_dmi_clear || (dtmcs_select && update && dtmcs_q.dmihardreset);
```

**Understanding the vulnerability**:

1. **Reset sources**: Two different ways to reset the debug interface
   - `jtag_dmi_clear`: Software-triggered reset
   - `dtmcs_q.dmihardreset`: Hardware-triggered reset

2. **The race condition**: These resets can occur simultaneously, creating timing windows where:
   - One reset starts but doesn't complete
   - Debug state is partially cleared
   - Attacker can exploit the timing window

3. **Visual timeline of the attack**:
```
Time:     0ns    5ns    10ns   15ns   20ns
JTAG:     ____██████_________________
HW Reset: _________████_______________
Result:   Partial reset - some state preserved!
```

**Attack scenario**:
```systemverilog
// Attacker manipulates reset timing
fork
  begin
    // Start JTAG reset
    jtag_dmi_clear = 1'b1;
    #10ns;  // Hold for 10 nanoseconds
    jtag_dmi_clear = 1'b0;
  end
  begin  
    // Simultaneously trigger hardware reset with precise timing
    #5ns;   // Wait 5ns to create overlap
    trigger_hardware_reset();
  end
join

// Now some debug state may persist when it should be cleared
```

### Vulnerability Category 3: Alert Handler Bypass

#### Bug #4: Spurious Ping Detection Bypass

**Location**: `hw/ip_templates/alert_handler/rtl/alert_handler_ping_timer.sv`, line 285-291

**Background - What is the ping mechanism?**:
The alert handler regularly sends "ping" signals to verify that security monitoring is working. If pings fail, it indicates a security breach.

**Vulnerable Code**:
```systemverilog
// Spurious ping detection logic
prim_buf u_prim_buf_spurious_alert_ping (
  .in_i(|(alert_ping_ok_i & ~alert_ping_req_o)),  // Detect unexpected responses
  .out_o(spurious_alert_ping)
);

// Later in FSM:
alert_ping_fail_o = spurious_alert_ping;  // Report failure
```

**The vulnerability explained**:

1. **Purpose**: Detect when ping responses arrive without corresponding requests (spurious responses)
2. **The flaw**: The detection logic only checks current ping state, not historical context
3. **Attack vector**: Attacker can manipulate timing to send responses that appear legitimate

**Attack scenario**:
```systemverilog
// Attacker's manipulation sequence:
1. Wait for legitimate ping request
2. Delay the response slightly  
3. Send multiple responses
4. The logic may not detect all spurious responses
5. Attacker's malicious activity goes undetected
```

#### Bug #5: Ping Enable Bypass

**Location**: `hw/ip_templates/alert_handler/rtl/alert_handler.sv`, line 150

**Vulnerable Code**:
```systemverilog
(reg2hw_wrap.ping_enable == 0))  // Check if ping is disabled
```

**The vulnerability**:
1. **Design intent**: Pings should only be disabled during specific safe conditions
2. **The flaw**: No additional protection prevents unauthorized disabling
3. **Impact**: Attacker who can write to registers can disable security monitoring

**Why this matters**:
- Alert handler is the security "watchdog" of the system
- Disabling pings is like turning off a security camera
- Once disabled, attacker activities won't trigger alerts

### Vulnerability Category 4: Entropy and Randomness Issues

#### Bug #6: Predictable LFSR Entropy

**Location**: `hw/ip_templates/alert_handler/rtl/alert_handler_ping_timer.sv`, line 97-122

**Background - What is LFSR?**:
LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register) is a method to generate pseudo-random numbers. The alert handler uses it to randomize ping timing.

**Vulnerable Code**:
```systemverilog
logic [LfsrWidth-1:0] entropy;
assign entropy = (reseed_en) ? edn_data_i[LfsrWidth-1:0] : '0;

prim_lfsr #(
  .LfsrDw      ( LfsrWidth          ),
  .EntropyDw   ( LfsrWidth          ),
  .StateOutDw  ( LfsrWidth          ),
  .DefaultSeed ( RndCnstLfsrSeed    ),  // Constant seed!
  .StatePermEn ( 1'b1               ),
  .ScrambleEn  ( 1'b1               )
) u_prim_lfsr (
  .clk_i      ( clk_i                ),
  .rst_ni     ( rst_ni               ),
  .lfsr_en_i  ( reseed_en || cnt_set ),
  .seed_en_i  ( reseed_en            ),
  .entropy_i  ( entropy              ),
  .state_o    ( lfsr_state           )
);
```

**The vulnerability**:
1. **Predictable seed**: `RndCnstLfsrSeed` is a compile-time constant
2. **Limited entropy**: If external entropy source fails, falls back to zero
3. **Attack potential**: Attacker can predict ping timing patterns

**Impact**:
- Predictable ping timing allows attacker to time attacks between pings
- Can avoid detection by exploiting known quiet periods
- Reduces effectiveness of the security monitoring system

### Competition Submission Format - Complete Template

Each bug submission for Hack@CHES'25 must include the following fields:

**Bug Submission #1 - Debug Access Control Bypass**

#### Security feature bypassed
Debug module access control and privilege validation system

#### Finding
The debug module CSR interface in `dm_csrs.sv` contains a critical security vulnerability where privilege validation is completely absent for debug operations. Specifically, lines 380-420 handle debug register write requests without any authentication or authorization checks.

The vulnerable code path processes DMI (Debug Module Interface) write requests directly:

```systemverilog
if (dmi_req_i.op == dm::DTM_WRITE) begin
  unique case (dmi_req_i.addr)
    dm::DMControl: begin
      dmcontrol_d = dmi_req_i.data;  // NO PRIVILEGE CHECK
    end
    dm::Command: begin
      command_d = dmi_req_i.data;    // NO AUTHORIZATION
    end
```

This allows any entity with JTAG access to write to critical debug control registers, enabling complete system takeover without proper authentication.

#### Location or code reference
**File**: `./hw/vendor/pulp_riscv_dbg/src/dm_csrs.sv`  
**Line**: 380-420  

**Exploit code**:
```systemverilog
// Proof-of-concept exploit demonstrating unauthorized debug access
module debug_exploit_poc;
  
  // Simulate unauthorized JTAG access
  initial begin
    $display("=== Debug Access Control Bypass Exploit ===");
    
    // Step 1: Connect to debug interface without authentication
    reset_debug_interface();
    
    // Step 2: Write to DMControl register to activate debug mode
    write_dmi_register(dm::DMControl, 32'h80000001);  // dmactive=1, haltreq=1
    
    // Step 3: Verify CPU is now under attacker control
    #100;
    if (cpu_halted) begin
      $display("SUCCESS: CPU halted without authorization!");
      
      // Step 4: Execute arbitrary debug commands
      write_dmi_register(dm::Command, 32'h00271000);  // Read register command
      write_dmi_register(dm::Command, 32'h00371000);  // Write register command
      
      $display("SUCCESS: Can now read/write any CPU register or memory!");
    end else begin
      $display("FAILED: Exploit did not work");
    end
  end
  
  task write_dmi_register(input [31:0] addr, input [31:0] data);
    dmi_req.op = dm::DTM_WRITE;
    dmi_req.addr = addr;
    dmi_req.data = data;
    apply_dmi_request();
  endtask
  
endmodule
```

#### Detection method
**Tool**: Custom static analysis script combined with manual code review  
**Methodology**: 
1. **Automated Pattern Detection**: Developed Python script that scans SystemVerilog files for privilege check patterns using regex:
   ```python
   privilege_patterns = [
       r'(privilege|auth|permission).*check',
       r'(valid|verify).*access',
       r'security.*validation'
   ]
   ```
2. **Control Flow Analysis**: Manually traced execution paths from external interfaces to sensitive operations
3. **Verification Property**: Checked that all write operations to debug control registers include authorization validation

**Specific detection logic**:
```python
def detect_missing_privilege_check(file_content, line_num):
    # Look for write operations to debug registers
    if re.search(r'dmi_req_i\.op.*DTM_WRITE', file_content[line_num]):
        # Check surrounding context for privilege validation
        context = '\n'.join(file_content[max(0, line_num-10):line_num+10])
        if not re.search(r'(auth|privilege|permission)', context, re.IGNORECASE):
            return True  # Vulnerability detected
    return False
```

#### Security impact
This vulnerability provides complete system compromise capabilities:

**Immediate Impact**:
- **CPU Control**: Attacker can halt, resume, and single-step CPU execution
- **Memory Access**: Read and write arbitrary system memory including cryptographic keys
- **Register Manipulation**: Access and modify all CPU registers including security-critical ones
- **Code Injection**: Modify program execution flow to inject malicious code

**System-Wide Consequences**:
- **Secure Boot Bypass**: Can extract and modify boot firmware
- **Cryptographic Key Extraction**: Access to hardware security module keys
- **Persistent Backdoor**: Can modify firmware to establish permanent access
- **Supply Chain Risk**: Compromised systems can be used to attack other systems

**Real-World Scenario**: An attacker with brief physical access to a device could:
1. Connect to JTAG pins (often exposed on development boards)
2. Use this vulnerability to gain full system control
3. Extract all cryptographic keys and sensitive data
4. Install persistent backdoors in firmware
5. Use the compromised device as a launching point for network attacks

#### Adversary profile
**Primary Adversary**: Authorized debug access with privilege escalation intent
- **Capability**: Has legitimate debug access credentials but limited privileges
- **Motivation**: Seeks to escalate privileges to gain full system control
- **Access**: Physical access to JTAG interface or remote debug session
- **Skill Level**: Moderate - requires understanding of debug protocols but not advanced techniques

**Secondary Adversary**: Physical attacker with JTAG access
- **Capability**: Can physically access debug interface pins
- **Motivation**: System compromise for espionage or sabotage
- **Access**: Temporary physical access to device
- **Skill Level**: High - requires hardware knowledge and specialized tools

#### Proposed mitigation
**Immediate Fix**:
```systemverilog
// Add privilege checking to debug register writes
if (dmi_req_i.op == dm::DTM_WRITE) begin
  // First verify debug privileges
  if (!debug_authenticated) begin
    dmi_resp_o.resp = dm::DTM_ERR;
    security_violation_alert = 1'b1;
  end else if (!has_debug_privilege(dmi_req_i.addr)) begin
    dmi_resp_o.resp = dm::DTM_ERR;
    privilege_violation_alert = 1'b1;
  end else begin
    // Only proceed if properly authenticated and authorized
    unique case (dmi_req_i.addr)
      dm::DMControl: begin
        dmcontrol_d = dmi_req_i.data;
      end
      dm::Command: begin
        command_d = dmi_req_i.data;
      end
    endcase
  end
end
```

**Comprehensive Security Enhancement**:
1. **Multi-level Authentication**: Implement hardware-based authentication for debug access
2. **Privilege Separation**: Create separate privilege levels for different debug operations
3. **Audit Logging**: Log all debug access attempts with timestamps and user identification
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement delays between debug operations to prevent automated attacks
5. **Secure Debug Disable**: Provide tamper-resistant mechanism to permanently disable debug access

#### CVSSv3.1 Base score and severity
**High (8.2)**

#### CVSSv3.1 details
**Vector**: CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L

**Detailed Breakdown**:
- **Attack Vector (AV): Physical (P)** - Requires physical access to JTAG interface
- **Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)** - No special conditions required once JTAG access is obtained
- **Privileges Required (PR): None (N)** - No authentication needed to exploit
- **User Interaction (UI): None (N)** - Can be fully automated
- **Scope (S): Changed (C)** - Can impact components beyond the debug module
- **Confidentiality Impact (C): High (H)** - Can read all system memory and registers
- **Integrity Impact (I): High (H)** - Can modify any system data or code
- **Availability Impact (A): Low (L)** - Can halt system but limited permanent damage

**Justification for Score**:
- High confidentiality/integrity impact due to complete system access
- Physical attack vector limits accessibility but doesn't reduce impact
- Changed scope because debug access affects entire system security
- Low availability impact as primary goal is access, not denial of service

## Detection method
Static analysis of debug register write handling combined with control flow analysis. Identified through systematic examination of privilege check patterns in security-critical code paths.

## Security impact
This vulnerability allows an attacker with JTAG access to:
- Halt and resume CPU execution without authorization
- Read and write arbitrary system memory including cryptographic keys
- Execute arbitrary debug commands bypassing all security controls
- Modify program execution flow to inject malicious code
- Access secure boot secrets and firmware encryption keys

The vulnerability provides complete system compromise capabilities equivalent to having unrestricted root access to the hardware platform.

## Adversary profile
**Authorized debug access** - An attacker who has obtained legitimate debug access credentials but should be restricted to limited debugging operations. The vulnerability allows privilege escalation to full system control.

## Proposed mitigation
1. Implement privilege level checking before processing debug register writes
2. Add authentication verification for sensitive debug operations
3. Create separate privilege domains for different debug operations
4. Add audit logging for all debug register access attempts

```systemverilog
// Proposed fix - add privilege checking
if (dmi_req_i.op == dm::DTM_WRITE) begin
  // First verify debug privileges
  if (!debug_authenticated || !has_privilege(dmi_req_i.addr)) begin
    dmi_resp_o.resp = dm::DTM_ERR;
    // Log unauthorized access attempt
    security_violation_alert = 1'b1;
  end else begin
    // Only proceed if properly authenticated and authorized
    unique case (dmi_req_i.addr)
      dm::DMControl: begin
        dmcontrol_d = dmi_req_i.data;
      end
    endcase

## Test Case
```systemverilog
// Test: Unauthorized debug register access
initial begin
  // 1. Simulate unauthorized JTAG connection (no authentication)
  reset_debug_module();
  assert(!debug_authenticated) else $error("Should start unauthenticated");
  
  // 2. Attempt to write to critical debug control register
  dmi_req.op = dm::DTM_WRITE;
  dmi_req.addr = dm::DMControl;  
  dmi_req.data = 32'h80000001;   // Set dmactive and haltreq
  
  apply_dmi_request();
  
  // 3. Verify that unauthorized access succeeded (vulnerability!)
  assert(dmcontrol_q.dmactive) 
    else $error("Debug module should be active (shows vulnerability)");
  assert(dmcontrol_q.haltreq) 
    else $error("CPU halt should be requested (shows vulnerability)");
    
  // 4. Confirm system compromise
  #100;  // Wait for halt to take effect
  assert(cpu_halted) 
    else $error("CPU should be halted by unauthorized debug access");
end
```
```

## Advanced Topics

### Understanding Hardware Security

**Why Hardware Security Matters**:
- Software security depends on hardware being trustworthy
- Hardware vulnerabilities can't be fixed with software updates
- Root of Trust provides foundation for all other security

**Common Hardware Vulnerability Types**:
1. **Side-channel attacks** - Information leaked through power consumption, timing, etc.
2. **Fault injection** - Manipulating the chip's operation through external interference
3. **Access control bypass** - Circumventing intended restrictions
4. **State confusion** - Exploiting unexpected system states

### SystemVerilog Security Patterns

**Secure Coding Practices**:
```systemverilog
// GOOD: Proper reset handling
always_ff @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
  if (!rst_n) begin
    // Reset ALL registers to known safe state
    sensitive_reg <= SAFE_DEFAULT_VALUE;
    control_reg <= '0;
    state_reg <= IDLE_STATE;
  end else begin
    // Normal operation logic
  end
end

// GOOD: Privilege checking
if (request_valid && has_privilege(user_id, requested_operation)) begin
  // Only proceed if authorized
  perform_operation();
end else begin
  // Log security violation
  security_alert <= 1'b1;
end
```

### Competition Strategy

**Effective Bug Hunting Techniques**:
1. **Focus on interfaces** - Places where different components connect
2. **Analyze state machines** - Look for unexpected state transitions
3. **Check error handling** - Often overlooked in design
4. **Examine reset logic** - Critical for security but complex
5. **Look for privilege boundaries** - Where access control should exist

**Tool Development**:
- Automated pattern matching accelerates initial discovery
- Manual analysis confirms and exploits vulnerabilities
- Test case development proves impact
- Documentation ensures competition judges understand findings

This comprehensive analysis demonstrates systematic approach to hardware security assessment, suitable for academic research and industry security evaluation.
